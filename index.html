            <span>
                Indore started off as a trading hub between the Deccan and Delhi and has now become the largest city in
                Madhya Pradesh. It offers an excellent combination of majestic palaces coexisting with highly successful
                commercial centres. Indore is one of the first 20 cities to be developed as a smart city and has a
                growing
                urban population who enjoy the luxury of living in this dynamic city. As with any burgeoning city, space
                for
                multiple private vehicles is a constraint, and hence there is an increased demand for self drive cars in
                Indore.
